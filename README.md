# LocationFinder

“Where the SDU* am I?” is the hottest new app in  location sharing services, focused around the SDU  campus!
You have experienced this too many times to  count. You go to SDU, to work on a group project. 
You  or one of your mates finds an open workspace, and  now you/they have to communicate where they are.  
This means getting up, finding the rooms nameplate,  and writing the long descriptive name of the room.
“Where the SDU* am I?” says no more! You instead  open the app, which will find your location and then  the room you are in. 
You then just press the share  button, to inform your workmates of where you are! 
Easy, smooth, and to the point. “Where the SDU* am  I?”, your newest favorite app.
